## How to use?
1. Clone this Repository to local Drive.
2. Customize the script in main.py for configuration as you want in here:

```python
total_day = 366 #total days back
commit_frequency = 10 #commit time per day
repo_link = "https://github.com/Atharv-101/github-activity-generator/issues"  #Link your Repo here
```

3. Create an empty Github Repository can public or private, but I prefer you to make it private. do not initialize it.
4. Now Upload your edited Main.py to your new Github Repository.
5. Enable your Codespace in Github Repository.
6. After the script is already, you just run the script and see the magic.
7. After all the process is successful, please press the star for this repository😊.
